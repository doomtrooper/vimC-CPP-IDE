VIM-C-CPP-IDE
=============

Introduction
-------------
This repository includes a **BASH script** that aims at modifying our VIM to change it into a better C/CPP IDE. This BASH Script will replace your, if existing, or make a new, if not existing, .vimrc configuration file to add some features to VIM.

Along with the changes in **.vimrc** a .vim folder, if not existing, will be createdto store the **skeleton files** for C or CPP files. These skeleton files is used to append some header whenever a new C or CPP file is created. Thus saving our time and resource.

Additionally, a plugin **NERDcommentor** will be installed. This plugin is pretty useful for commenting in a file.
